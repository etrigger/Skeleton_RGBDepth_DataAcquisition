Skeleton_RGBDepth_DataAcquisition
=================================

Written By: Adam Li C2014

Collects Skeleton Data and Saves Color and Depth Image Streams. Collects all 20 skeleton joints and saves x,y,z coordinate data into a csv file that is saved into the local folder. Will also save color and depth images into local 'Color' and 'Depth' Image folders, for post digital-processing. 

A slight filter/smoothing algorithm is applied for the skeleton joints.

*This will require an i7 processor with a decent amount of RAM and SSD preferred to handle the image saving at 30fps...
